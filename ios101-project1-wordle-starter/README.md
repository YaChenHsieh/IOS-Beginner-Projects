## Notes

Swift is a completely new language to me. Even though I have experience with other languages, concepts like closures, optionals (?), and weak self have been challenging. However, with the help of AI tools, I’ve been picking up these concepts step by step. Watching YouTube videos has also helped me understand how to use Playgrounds better!
