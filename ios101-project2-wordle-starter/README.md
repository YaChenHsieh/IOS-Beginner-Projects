## Notes

| **Question** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Why use `as? String`?** | `settings[kWordThemeKey]` may be `nil` or not a `String`, so we need to safely check and unwrap it. |
| **Why use `WordTheme(rawValue:)`?** | The `settings` dictionary stores the theme as a `String`, but `WordTheme` is an `enum`. We use `rawValue` to convert the string into the corresponding `enum` case. |
| **Why use `if let`?** | If the conversion to `WordTheme` fails, the code inside the block wonâ€™t execute, preventing errors. |
| **Why use `self.goalWord = WordGenerator.generateGoalWord(with: theme)`?** | This ensures that a new goal word is generated based on the selected theme. |
| **Why print `"Failed to get theme from settings"` in `else`?** | To help with debugging and ensure that the settings dictionary contains the expected values. |
